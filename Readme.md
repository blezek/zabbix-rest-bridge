# zabbix-rest-bridge

Creates a REST bridge for a [Zabbix server](https://www.zabix.com).
The [Zabbix protocol](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.2/manual/appendix/items/activepassive)
is _almost_ REST-like.  This application starts up a small REST server
handling POST and GET methods and forwards to the given Zabbix server,
returning the response.  Now CURL can be used to populate Zabbix.

## Install

    go get github.com/dblezek/zabbix-rest-bridge

## Running

    zabbix-rest-bridge --server zabbix.example.com

By default, `zabbix-rest-bridge` listens on port `8987` on all interfaces, forwarding requests to `zabbix.example.com` on port `10051`.

## Getting Help

    zabbix-rest-bridge -h

## Examples

Values can be `POST`ed by specifying `POST` parameters.  `key` is the Zabbix key, `value` is the value to association, and `host` is the hostname where this value came from.  For instance to post 'foo=1234' from 'hostname'.

    curl -v -X POST -d host="hostname" -d key=foo -d value=1234 localhost:8987

Well formed Zabbix JSON can be posted.  Post the contents of TestData.txt

    curl -v -X PUT -d @TestData.txt localhost:8987

TestData.txt:
```
{
   "request":"agent data",
   "data":[
       {
           "host":"hostname",
           "key":"foo",
           "value":"1234"
       }
   ]
}
```
